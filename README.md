### Project Description
This project features a Selenium automation script developed in Java, designed to navigate to the "Careers" section of the CommandLink website. The script employs an assertion method to confirm that the user is correctly redirected to the intended page. The implementation is straightforward yet effective, automating the process of accessing and verifying the "Careers" section. The **Thread.sleep** method was used only for visual validation to ensure that every step is clearly visible in the recorded video. The video is also attachedâ€”please check it out.
