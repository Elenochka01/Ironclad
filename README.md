### Project Description
This project features a Selenium automation script developed in Java. The script automates the process of testing the "Solution" and "Company" sections. The script employs an assertion method to confirm that the user is correctly redirected to the "Careers" page. The **Thread.sleep** method was used only for visual validation to ensure that every step is clearly visible in the recorded video. The video is also attachedâ€”please check it out.
